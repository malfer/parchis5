Parch√≠s pairs rules

In pairs game mates are on opposite sides, so one pair are
yellow and red and another pair are green and blue.

Play rules are the same as in single game, except for the
next differences:

    Two pawns from a same pair in the same square form a
      blockade.
    When you have a mate pawn at the square destination,
      you can choose to eat it and advance 20 squares or to
      do a blockade.
    If you roll a 5 and there are a mate pawn and a
      opponent pawn in the start square, you eat the
      opponent pawn, even if this pawn was there first.

The pair of the first player that have his four pawns in
goal wins the game.
